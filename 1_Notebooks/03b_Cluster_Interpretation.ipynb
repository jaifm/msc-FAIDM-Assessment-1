    "*   **Habits**: They are highly regular (low `Regularity` score of 1.22) and submit assessments significantly early (avg -40 days `Procrastination`).\n",
    "*   **Risk Profile**: **Low Risk**. These students are self-regulated and likely high performers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster 0: \"The Mainstream Learners\" (Moderate Engagement)\n",
    "*   **Behaviour**: The largest or \"average\" group. They demonstrate moderate `Intensity` (avg ~785) and `Breadth` (avg ~49).\n",
    "*   **Habits**: They are reasonably regular (`Regularity` ~3.11) and submit assignments close to the deadline (avg -3 days). They do what is required but do not exhibit the \"super-user\" behaviour of Cluster 1.\n",
    "*   **Risk Profile**: **Moderate Risk**. While stable, they lack the buffer of high engagement. A drop in activity could signal emerging issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster 2: \"The Disengaged / At-Risk\" (Low Engagement)\n",
    "*   **Behaviour**: This is the priority group for intervention. They show **minimal engagement** with very low `Intensity` (avg ~108) and `Breadth` (avg ~15).\n",
    "*   **Habits**: The defining characteristic is **extreme irregularity** (`Regularity` score of ~18.0, far higher than other clusters). Their study patterns are sporadic and unpredictable.\n",
    "*   **Risk Profile**: **High Risk**. The combination of low activity and erratic behaviour makes them prime candidates for early dropout or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intervention Strategy Recommendations\n",
    "1.  **Monitor Cluster 2**: Automated alerts for students exhibiting high `Regularity` scores (irregularity). Reach out to offer study planning support.\n",
    "2.  **Nudge Cluster 0**: Encourage broader material coverage (`Breadth`) to move them towards the Cluster 1 profile.\n",
    "3.  **Recognise Cluster 1**: No intervention needed, but their data can serve as a benchmark for \"successful\" behaviour patterns.\n"
